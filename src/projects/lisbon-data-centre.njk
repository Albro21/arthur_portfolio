  <h2 class="text-stone-50 text-xl font-bold mb-4">Project Overview</h2>
  <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    The Lisbon Data Center is strategically located in Lisbon, Portugal, one of Europe's emerging technology hubs. This state-of-the-art facility serves as a critical infrastructure node for businesses operating across Southern Europe and provides excellent connectivity to both European and transatlantic networks.
  </p>
  <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    The facility provides 3,162 m² of colocation space with a total IT capacity of 10 megawatts (MW). Designed with scalability in mind, the facility supports future expansion to meet growing market demands.
  </p>
  <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Lisbon Data Centre features advanced cooling systems, redundant power infrastructure with N+1 configuration, and comprehensive security measures. The facility is engineered to maintain optimal performance and reliability for mission-critical applications.
  </p>
  <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed">
    The project utilized a full building modular design approach, where all MEP systems were prefabricated off-site in controlled warehouse conditions and transported to Lisbon for final assembly, ensuring superior quality control and accelerated construction timelines.
  </p>
  <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed">
    Lisbon Data Centre is a unique project for us, as it was fully prefabricated in an off-site warehouse and subsequently assembled on site in Lisbon, Portugal. This approach requires exceptional quality and precision to ensure a smooth, bolt-to-bolt installation during on-site assembly.
